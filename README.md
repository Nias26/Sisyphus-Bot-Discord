# Sisyphus Discord Bot

Simple bot that enters your voicechat after some time and yells some of sisyphus lines from [ULTRAKILL](devilmayquake.com).

Invite the bot to your server: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1387053750832599212&permissions=35188670205200&integration_type=0&scope=bot`

Run it from source:
- Install Dependencies:
    ```
    npm i && npm fund
    ```
- Get your discord bot token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and put the `TOKEN` to the `.env` file
- Run the app:
    ```
    node .
    ```

Enjoy!
